I’m a Full Stack Software Developer at Hombaez, where I’ve built out key features like real-time messaging, user authentication, and dynamic data updates using React and Firebase. My work includes developing components for handling real-time notifications, managing user sessions, and creating responsive UI elements that adapt to different devices. I’ve also implemented performance optimization strategies to ensure that the applications run smoothly, even with a large number of concurrent users. Additionally, I’ve contributed to designing intuitive user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience by making complex tasks easy to navigate.
